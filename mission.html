          <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
          <p>
            Our commitment is to communities and the families living in them.</p>
            <p>Humanity has always faced challenges.</p> 
            <p>This will not change.</p>
            <p>We will always face challenges. </p>

            <p>How we deal with those challenges defines who we are, who we become. </p>
           <p> At CoMake it is our mission to help communities connect with each other as we strive to find excellent, <br>sustainable, replicable and empowering solutions to the challenges that face us. </p>

            <h1>Vision Statement</h1>
            <p>
              <p>We envision a future where families can connect and work together. We envision a future where there are no barriers in our community. </p>
  
              <p>Social distancing will not always be part of our lives, but for now, having a way to connect with other families, to share solutions, problems, victories, and challenges all make life worth living and bring strength to our community. </p>
              
              <p>As we build out, we will include more communities. At the core, all families want the same things. We want for our children to do well, to be healthy, to succeed in reaching their dreams, to build our communities better than they have ever been. To do that, we must bridge divides and build understanding. Our differences bring us great strength and by connecting with each other we can more fully realize our potential. </p>
             
              <p>We are CoMake.</p>
              <p>Together we will build a bright future. </p>
